# gsk_Miraculon-B_project

In the realm of cancer research, people are constantly seeking ways to enhance treatment outcomes 
and provide hope for patients and their loved ones. This project presents an opportunity to evaluate 
the effectiveness of a promising new cancer treatment known as Miraculon-B, specifically for solid 
tumors.
Our primary objective is to gain a comprehensive understanding of which patient subgroups might 
experience more favorable responses to this innovative treatment, thereby offering them the 
potential for improved outcomes. To facilitate our analysis, GSK has generously provided us with 
two datasets: clinical-study.csv and protein-levels.csv. The clinical-study.csv dataset encompasses 
detailed information on 772 patients, including essential variables such as age, weight, and, 
notably, the treatment response itself. Through careful examination, we aim to determine whether 
patients who received Miraculon-B exhibited more favorable treatment outcomes in comparison 
to those in the control group. Moreover, the protein-levels.csv dataset provides valuable insights 
into the concentration of a specific protein that could serve as a predictive biomarker for solid 
tumors. By thoroughly exploring this dataset, we hope to uncover whether factors like age, weight, 
or protein concentration can serve as indicators of a patient's likelihood to respond positively to 
Miraculon-B.
